### Hey there üëã

I am Remi (he/him), a software developer, a writer, and a former stained-glass master (yup) from France. I've worked in tech for ten years, and I've been a professional developer for the past five years, mainly focusing on back-end programming.

I share what I learn while building software on [my website](https://remimercier.com/).

### My daily contributions
As an Individual Contributor, my daily contributions revolve around:
* designing and implementing features with robustness and implications in mind,
* code architecture,
* codebase consolidation, untangling legacy code, and increasing code coverage, 
* shipping APIs used by millions of users,
* interacting with databases,
* troubleshooting,
* mentoring junior developers,
* documenting practices and processes,
* laughing way too loud during meetings (please adjust your headphones levels üôè)
